## **Set Up**

**This code requires:**

•	MATLAB

•	Python

•	sklearn/tensorflow/keras/numpy/xlrd/pandas libraries

## **Data Preparation**

To investigate the impact of power supply interruptions on the microgrid operations, **we assume during extreme weather-related events, the utility grid goes down for a certain period, and the microgrid operates in an isolated mode during this period**. The **RG outputs** are taken from the system advisory model by **the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the city of Phoenix, AZ (https://sam.nrel.gov/)**. For the load-demand, **a small residential community load-demand data** is collected from **https://openei.org/wiki/Data**.

### Example of Data Generation

Here is an example to generate data for the latter implementation of our proposed **MAIL** method.

Assume we discrete the SOC state into 51 sizes, and the interrupted time is from $10^{th}$ to $13^{th}$ hour (T=24, a day for 24 hours).

```Run the MATLAB code MAIL/GM 2024_Matlab/mainDP_Interrupted.m```

Then you will get a **interrupt10-13_dp51.xls** file and some output figures. This is one expert demonstration generated by the Dynamic Programming method in the scenario that extreme weather-related events happen at time $10^{th}-13^{th}$ (totally 4 hours).

To implement our proposed MAIL method, you still need to generate other scenarios' expert demonstrations, since there will be several virtual agents to solve different cases in MAIL method. 

For example, we consider three virtual environments that the power supply interruptions happen at the time-period $10^{th}-13^{th}$ hours, $11^{th}-14^{th}$ hours, and $12^{th}-15^{th}$ hours. Three local virtual agents are applied to imitate the corresponding virtual environment's actions. So you need to change **fault_time = [10 11 12 13]** to **fault_time = [11 12 13 14]**  in the **mainDP_Interrupted.m** file to generate **interrupt11-14_dp51.xls**, and change **fault_time = [10 11 12 13]** to **fault_time = [12 13 14 15]** to generate **interrupt12-15_dp51.xls**. 

These files are already included in the MAIL/GM 2024_Python filefolder now.

## **Implematation of MAIL Method**
### Generate Learner Policy and Output Results

Once you have the expert demonstrations for different cases, you can start to implement the MAIL method in the MAIL/GM 2024_Python filefolder.

```Run the main.py file```

You will get the result of MAIL method: policy10-15_max3_dp11.csv. This is a policy learn for the scenario that extreme weather-related events happen at time $10^{th}-15^{th}$ (totally 6 hours), which are different from expert scenarios.

```Run the calculate_cost.py file```

You will get the cost of this learned policy and a "result_of_interruption10-15_max_dp51.csv" file including 7 rows of output results: Battery_soc, power from grid,	power to grid,	battery discharged power,	battery charged power,	and dg output.

### Plot Figures

Copy "result_of_interruption10-15_max_dp51.csv" to MAIL/GM 2024_Matlab filefolder.

```Run the plot_result.m file```

You will get the output figure of the proposed MAIL method.

You can also use plot_batt_pol.m and plot_cost.m files to compare results of different methods: such as Aggregated Q-learning method and DP method (These two methods' implementations are also included in our MAIL/GM 2024_Matlab filefolder: Cooperative_system.m and mainDP_Interrupted.m). If you want to compare different methods' results, you need to copy their result to comparative_batt_pol_soc51.csv and comparative_cost_soc51.csv before you run plot_batt_pol.m and plot_cost.m files (They are already included in the filefolders now).

The figures are shown as below.
